    "&emsp;For the purpose of this assignment, I am taking the role of a company that is interested in common F-150 issues and modifications. Perhaps an aftermarket parts supplier. I decided to stick with the 2015-2020 F-150 years, but some of the areas may slightly extend beyond this range. The first data source scraped is a popular F-150 forum, f150forum.com. This forum is popular for discussing and getting help relating to vehicle problems as well as getting advice or ideas for aftermarket modifications. This information is useful to me because I can scrape the forum to see which issues are most common and use this data to research a potential fix. Similarly, I can use this data to see which mods are most popular so I can market my products accordingly. The text I scraped is pretty high-level but still provides good insights. I grabbed the thread title which can be used to identify the issue or mod. I also scraped the last-updated timestamp as well as the view count to see the subject's popularity. The last two added columns were the date I visited the site and the main forum category (2015-2020 F-150s). No non-text fields were used.\n",
    "   \n",
    "&emsp;The second source I looked at is a popular aftermarket parts supplier called Stage 3 Motorsports (stage3motorsports.com). This data is relevant because I can see what the competition is doing (or not doing) to address some of the items identified from the first source. Since the top post of f150forum.com is about leveling kits I decided to use the spacer leveling kits page of Stage 3's site. I scraped the product name/description, the price, and average review for these products. This information can be used to see which products are most popular and could easily be extended to other product areas. I did include a non-text field from this source, but I converted it to text. The average review was listed as an image-link so I was able to grab and transform this into useful text."

    "#### Q2. Write a short description comparing the context surrounding each of the two data sources. Make sure your answer is no longer than three paragraphs, and should at minimum answer these questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### How different is the context in which the data were generated (e.g. news vs. social media)?\n",
    "\n",
    "##### How technically different was the collection and manipulation of these two data sources?\n",
    "\n",
    "##### How do the contextual and technical differences influence the data’s relevance or usefulness for your company?\n",
    "\n",
    "&emsp;This data was generated by significantly different means. The first source, f150forum.com, is a forum/thread type of website where each thread is created by a user. Other users can add to the threads as well. The second source, stage3motorsports.com, is an online retailer. The only user-influenced data is the average rating for each product. Stage 3 manages all of the other content (at least the content that I'm concerned with).\n",
    "\n",
    "&emsp;The collection and manipulation of each data source was actually pretty similar. The forum was a little more difficult mostly due to how the web page elements were named. Many of the specific areas I needed did not have an individual defining factor that made the data easy to pull out, such as a specific \"class\". Most of the beautifulsoup code was similar, however, and even some elements of manipulation via python were the same. I used lists with the split function to do the bulk of the work.\n",
    "\n",
    "&emsp;I think the information gained from each source is fairly different. The forum data has the potential to be a lot more detailed and could provide much more valuable information than the retail store. It consists of real people posting common (or not-so-common) issues, popular modifications, and tips and tricks that may not be very obvious without some trial and error. I think there is more to gain from mining the forum based on this. The store, however, provides insights to what solutions may already be available and would be useful in possibly creating something that does not exist yet. It could also be used to improve upon an already existing solution. Both sources are useful but for different reasons."
