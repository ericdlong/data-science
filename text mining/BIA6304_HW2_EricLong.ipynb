    "&emsp;The preprocessing steps performed include converting contractions (for example, \"I'd\" to \"I would\") and removing stop words. The stop word list used was NLTK. Contractions were removed to make the text standardized for sentiment analysis. The stop words were removed to allow less processing when performing sentiment analysis. The words removed generally do not have an impact on sentiment. I am not sure the preprocessing had a huge impact on determining sentiment since the changes just removed words that are not evaluated in the first place. There are some areas where it could cause an issue based on certain phrases in the sentiment dictionary. For example, \"can't stand\" has a -3 sentiment in AFINN so it potentially could have been missed after my preprocessing. Outside of code related issues I did not run into many mishaps. I intentionally kept preprocessing to a minimum, instead focusing on two sentiment dictionaries to see how different the results may be."

    "&nbsp; I used two different measures for sentiment analysis. The first was the AFINN dictionary, followed by the HL dictionary. I chose to use two so I could compare the results with the actual review ratings. AFINN is considerably smaller than HL, so there could be significant differences. As expected, the HL analysis with the larger dictionary provided results more in-line with the actual review ratings. The HL method resulted in 8965 positive reviews compared to 7689 original positive ratings. However, both AFINN and HL runs resulted in a lot of misses for neutral and negative comments. Therefore, in terms of usefulness I am not sure I'd consider any of the results particularly great.\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp; I think there are a couple of different things I could have done to produce more accurate results. First, adding more specific \"hotel\" words to the sentiment dictionaries would help. More specifically, I think some multiple word phrases would have been helpful. For example, the word \"bed\" might not be significant but \"bed comfortable\" would be a positive comment. Another one is \"location\"; this doesn't sound like much but some of the surronding words provide some insight. Also, in retrospect I should have performed sentiment analysis on the original text (before preprocessing) to see how close the calculated results matched with the original ratings. This would provide a better baseline for comparing the preprocessed text."
